# JKA (Java Kick Application)

JKA is an API for connecting to Kick chats, allowing you to receive and manage events. With JKA, you can create chatbots, implement moderation features, and more.

## Features

- Connect to Kick chat rooms
- Receive and process chat events
- Create custom chatbots
- Implement moderation tools
- Extensible for additional functionality

## Getting Started

To use JKA in your project, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.yourdomain</groupId>
    <artifactId>jka</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```java
import com.yourdomain.jka.KickClient;
import com.yourdomain.jka.events.ChatMessageEvent;

public class SimpleBot {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        KickClient client = new KickClient("YOUR_BOT_USERNAME", "YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN");
        
        client.onChatMessage(event -> {
            String message = event.getMessage();
            String sender = event.getSender();
            
            if (message.equalsIgnoreCase("!hello")) {
                client.sendMessage("Hello, " + sender + "!");
            }
        });
        
        client.connect("CHANNEL_NAME");
    }
}
```

This example creates a simple bot that responds with a greeting when a user types "!hello" in the chat.
